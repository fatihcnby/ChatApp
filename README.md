<h1> ChapApp </h1>

Chat application I made with React...

People registered in the application can chat among themselves and send pictures and documents to each other.

It can also be used on computers and mobile devices such as tablets and mobile phones.

I used React and Sass during the design phase. I used Firebase to store the information (Authentication, Database, Storage).
